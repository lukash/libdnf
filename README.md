To install build requirements, run::

    $ dnf builddep libdnf.spec --define '_with_sanitizers 1' [--define '_without_<option> 1 ...]

To build code, run::

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DWITH_SANITIZERS=ON [-DWITH_<OPTION>=<ON|OFF> ...]
    $ make -j4

To build rpms from git, run::

    $ export PREFIX=$(rpmspec libdnf.spec -q --srpm --qf '%{name}-%{version}'); git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=$PREFIX/ HEAD > $PREFIX.tar.gz
    $ rpmbuild -ba --define "_sourcedir $(pwd)" libdnf.spec [--with=<option>|--without=<option> ...]


Testing
-------
To run the tests, follow the steps to build the code and then run::

    # from the 'build' directory
    $ CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test

As an alternative, tests can be executed in a verbose mode::

    # from the 'build' directory
    $ make test ARGS='-V'
